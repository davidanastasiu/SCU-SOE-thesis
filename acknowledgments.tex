I would like to thank my advisor, for being the greatest advisor in the world.

I would also like to thank Dr. Nam Ling, the Chair of the Computer Science and Engineering Department, for assisting me in navigating the requirements of the degree that is about to be conferred upon me.

Last, but not least, I would like to thank my family. Without their support, I would have never been able to complete this thesis or pursue my dreams.
